Javascript Conventions 

camelCase for variables and functions 
UPPERCASE for constants 
For class names, use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase). This means capitalizing the first letter of each word, including the first word
use descriptive names 
line lenght <80
Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas
Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks
Always end a simple statement with a semicolon
Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
Use one space before the opening bracket.
Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.
Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
Do not start names with a $ sign. It will put you in conflict with many JavaScript library names.
use prettier as a code formatter 
If the purpose or logic of the code isn't obvious, add a comment with your intention
Declare variables at the top of their scope
